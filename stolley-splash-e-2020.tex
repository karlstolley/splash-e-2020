\begin{abstract}
This course experience report details the teaching of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) constrained by the rules of objective typography. The approach guides students in applying those rules to a subset of fewer than a dozen CSS properties. Students learn how to determine and reason about rule-governed values and ratios according to typographic principles. When successful, students produce typeset text that is accessible and readable across the range of screens and user-set preferences on web-enabled devices. Students learn to visually and mathematically verify the execution of their designs, and to apply the  rigor of objective typography to other areas of CSS, such as grid-based page layout. Experiential evidence suggests that these techniques do transfer to other aspects of CSS, but formal study is needed.

\section{Introduction}

At least two factors make CSS a challenging language to teach. First, CSS bears little resemblance to other languages in the web curriculum or in the curriculums of computer science and information technology generally. Even comparing languages only in the web curriculum, HTML can trace its ancestry to SGML and its contemporaries to XML. JavaScript has a complicated history but shares the features of many prototyped, procedural languages. By contrast, CSS’s closest relative is an obscure one: Simple Tree Transformation Sheets (STTS)\cite{w3c:briefhistory}, which used the selector-declaration syntax found in CSS. CSS's outlier status means that knowledge of other languages has limited transfer to CSS.

Second, CSS is a challenge to teach because the language continues to grow. Since the original CSS specification was published in late 1996, the CSS language has expanded considerably in capability as well as complexity: the 53 properties in the CSS 1 specification more than doubled to 115 in CSS 2.1/2.2. The modules that comprise CSS3 included  363 properties \cite{jom:css}. As of October 2020, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) estimates that CSS contains or is proposed to contain 533 distinct properties, spread across 145 different technical reports and editors' drafts \cite{w3c:iop}. At its most basic, CSS works by targeting and styling specific structures found in HTML documents. Because each CSS property has a very specific purpose (specifying text and background colors; italicizing or bolding text, for basic examples), CSS properties are not generalizable or easily used to suit other purposes. That stands in contrast to the core methods and functions of most other languages. Instruction in CSS can therefore devolve into trying to cover a growing list of properties.

 Students also face their own challenges learning CSS. As the language has grown, overwhelmed students often skip the fundamentals in favor of searching for tutorials that describe complicated visual effects and gimmicks, such as parallax scrolling, which inevitably lead to a lot of cut-and-paste code and little transferable learning.

CSS instruction constrained by typographic principles addresses the  complexity of CSS and attempts to solve the following problems students routinely face learning CSS:


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Where to start?} CSS can specify many visual qualities,  in just about any order. CSS neither enforces an order nor establishes any given properties as necessary, in contrast to the precise requirements of HTML.
  \item \textbf{What values to use?} And what units to express CSS values in? Left to their own devices, students pick values more or less out of thin air, or from other, inappropriate contexts: {\itshape Google Docs defaults to a text size of 11, so I’ll use 11 on this web page, too.}
  \item \textbf{When is it “finished”?} Compared to a set of style declarations in CSS, the content-completeness of an HTML document or the feature-completeness of a JavaScript function are more obviously verified, even by beginners.
\end{itemize}

The approach to CSS instruction described here developed out of an effort to present CSS as equally systematic and rule-governed as well written HTML and JavaScript. Students are introduced to CSS at a critical moment, when they have become more confident in their HTML skills but are eagerly looking to create their own custom page designs.


\section{Instructional Context}

This approach has been used several times over a four-year period in the first course of a two-course sequence in introductory web-development. Both courses in the sequence are required of all undergraduate majors in an information technology and management program. Students often take the sequence in their sophomore years. The first course, Fundamentals of Web Development, covers the syntax and semantics of standards-based HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The second course, Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design, introduces theories of user-centered design and human-computer interaction, anchored to common web design problems.

The Fundamentals of Web Development course typically enrolls between 30 and 40 students. Classroom instruction is largely lecture based, featuring live-coded demonstrations with ample opportunity for student questions. Students complete between five and ten small lab assignments, including one on objective typography and CSS, which are discussed on the course's electronic discussion boards. 

The bulk of student work in the course, however, is organized around three major projects, completed by each student individually. The first project requires students to develop the semantic HTML foundation for a multi-page website. Students are free to choose the subject matter of their sites, which has lead in almost all cases to students being substantially invested in all of the major course projects. Most students opt to begin developing a professional web presence for themselves, while others choose to create websites for campus clubs or even family businesses. The second project adds CSS and audio-visual elements to the HTML work completed in the first project, although students continue to refine and improve their HTML. The third and final project is a revision and refactoring of the second project, in response to multiple rounds of peer and instructor feedback, and requires students to include a JavaScript feature. A copy of the complete course syllabus is available on the web\cite{kas:fwd}.

Both courses in the sequence teach accessibility as a core web-engineering principle. That is expressed in part by the philosophy of progressive enhancement, which the course projects reflect. Progressive enhancement rests on a foundation of semantic HTML, free from all presentational elements and attributes. The HTML is then styled by a single, site-wide CSS file. HTML and CSS can be further augmented by unobtrusive JavaScript that leverages event listeners and the browser’s Document Object Model (DOM) to add page interactivity and feature enhancements not achievable by HTML or CSS.

\subsection{Objective Typography Principles}

Typography is a familiar design feature for students to approach. Students may not have worked with color theory or page layout before, but all have selected a preferred typeface on a document or in a slide template. Typography also functions at a human scale, making it a useful constant when designing for the web across the range of wearable, handheld, and desktop devices. Graphic designer Ellen Lupton observes that “Words originated as gestures of the body. The first typefaces were modeled on the forms of calligraphy.” \cite[p.~13]{el:type}.

Objective rules for the use of type--“the correct spaces between letters and words and the length and spacing of lines conducive to easy reading” \cite[p.~19]{mb:grid}--trace their origins to the at least the Industrial Revolution. They achieve fuller and more exacting description in the work of mid-twentieth-century European designers such as Josef Müller-Brockmann’s {\itshape Grid Systems in Graphic Design}, which specifically labeled the principles as constituting “objective typography” \cite[p.~7]{mb:grid}.

The basic rules of objective typography are echoed and refined across a number of contemporary book-length works that I have assigned in whole or as excerpts in web development classes: Ellen Lupton’s {\itshape Thinking with Type}, Robert Bringhurst’s {\itshape The Elements of Typographic Style}, and Jason Santa Maria’s {\itshape On Web Typography} \cite{el:type,rb:style,jsm:owt}. An open-access book that has also been a student favorite is Matthew Butterick’s {\itshape Practical Typography} \cite{mb:pt}. It is essential for students to have some available typography reference to understand both the significance of the work that they are doing, and also to consistently apply and express the rules of objective typography through CSS.

\subsection{Instructional Approach in Brief}

Applying the rules of objective typography to CSS focuses students on determining two values--a font-size and a line-height--and initially applying those values across fewer than a dozen CSS properties. The font-size is chosen based upon a narrow range of readable values at a given viewport or device size: too small, and the text is difficult to perceive, let alone read. Too large, and on phone-sized devices and screens, too few words appear on a single line, which hampers reading by making writing appear choppy. The line-height, which is selected based on the font-size for comfortable reading, establishes a predictable, repeating baseline for text to sit upon. That repeating baseline is also known as the typographic grid. 

Of course, text set at a single size on a uniform grid is neither exciting nor pleasant to read, so students learn to apply a ratio to their base font-size to arrive at precise values for larger text (headings, for example) and smaller text (captions and fine print). Those alternative type sizes are, however, always anchored by the original readable, accessible base font-size. Students also learn to add additional space above and below headings, list items, and other text features. That additional space is always a fraction or multiple of the base line-height value.

\section{Instructional Rationale and Method}

Applied to CSS instruction, objective typography offers a number of advantages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is rule- and principle-governed, which clarifies the objectives of both instruction and assessment
  \item It limits the scope of initial CSS instruction to just a handful of properties and techniques
  \item Its expression in CSS exposes students to numerous features of the language, especially inheritance, where a value set on one property affects the initial value or behavior of another property, even when set on another HTML element
  \item It introduces students to the process of translating and transposing external rules or visual plans from abstract concepts to concrete declarations in CSS
  \item It establishes a core set of values and units that can be carried over into advanced layout methods and grid-based design
\end{itemize}

Teaching CSS constrained by objective typography is systematic but leaves open room for experimentation: Students work with both their own written copy and dummy {\itshape Lorem ipsum} text to determine a reasonable size for the body copy, initially expressed in absolute, pixels units. From there, students experiment with different values on the \verb|line-height| property to find an appropriate leading (pron. {\itshape ledding}) to separate the lines of running text. That value becomes the fundamental base-line grid for the page. Block elements (headings, paragraphs, lists and list items) can then be offset from one another with additional vertical space, based on the \verb|line-height| value. Students then convert those absolute values into relative values for greater accessibility. 

\subsection{Viewports and Devices}


Finally, students begin to open up the RDV to larger viewports and make targeted adjustments to their stylesheets, often using CSS media queries, to ensure an optimal text setting across a full range of device and viewport sizes.





after applying a reset stylesheet, which effectively strips away all default browser styles \cite{em:rc}, students are shown how to work with a mobile-sized viewport. Students begin by working with the responsive design view (RDV) in a development browser such as Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition (Figure \ref{fig:rdv}). The RDV provides a precise readout of the viewport's scale, and prevents students from the common pitfall of always designing for the web at the maximum viewport size their computer can display. The viewport in the RDV should be collapsed to a size that approximates the dimensions of a mobile phone. Students need to be reminded of this often. Students should be shown how and encouraged to make use of a lightweight local web server, such as the \verb|http-server| package written for Node.js \cite{npm:http}, so that they can learn as early as possible to view projects in progress over the local network on actual mobile and tablet devices, not just their own chosen development browser. It is usually only when students look at their work on a phone that they begin to really grasp designing for the smallest screens first.


Note that applying the fundamental principles of objective typography does not come close to fully exhausting the possibilities of CSS typography: the basic instructional approach excludes typographic flourishes and stylistic enhancements, especially font variants such as small caps, that can now be represented in stunning clarity on high-density displays.

For the purposes of learning this technique, students can be provided with a semantically structured HTML document from the instructor, or they can work from their own HTML, perhaps as part of a larger project. The HTML should use the viewport \verb|<meta>| element to set mobile devices to display at their native resolutions.

Because of the varying availability of typefaces on different operating systems, instructors should suggest a few web-available typefaces, such as from Google Fonts, for students to work with. Ideally, the candidate typefaces should have anatomical features that lend themselves to long-form reading: moderate stroke contrast, a large x-height, and pronounced ascenders and descenders \cite[p.~36]{jsm:owt}. The typefaces in Figure \ref{fig:bvos} all exhibit those features.

\subsection{Sizing Body Type}

Selecting an appropriate size for body type is the most critical step in the process, because that size value determines all of the other values that follow. While keeping critical eyes on both the RDV emulator and the mobile phone, students can begin to experiment discovering a suitable base font-size for the page.

Students have been surprised to learn that there isn’t a universal readable-size value: because the optical size of a typeface (that is, its visible letterforms) differs from its body size (the invisible boxes around letterforms), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bvos}, there is no universal readable-size value--only certain likely ranges of sizes, which must be carefully adjusted based on the unique characteristics of a given typeface.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{bvos}
  \caption{Comparison of body (top) versus optical (bottom) sizes on three typefaces: Fira Sans, Merriweather, and Lato. To match the optical size of Merriweather (center), Fira Sans (left) must be sized to 106\% of Merriweather's body size; Lato (right) to 110\%.} The top and bottom lines of each set represent the ascender and descender lines, respectively. The middle two lines illustrate the x-height.
  \Description{A screenshot showing different visual sizes on three different typefaces, and their visually uniform size when adjusted.}
  \label{fig:bvos}
\end{figure}


But rather than try different size values in an unstudied way, students can scaffold text-sizing according to common defaults and accessibility guidelines. By default, most desktop browsers set their base font-size to sixteen pixels. A good reset stylesheet should not interfere with that default size. The latest version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) refrains from making any specific text-size prescriptions; the WCAG does, however, note that “the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font,” and also that “point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does” \cite{w3c:wcag}.

The Lighthouse Guild, formerly the National Association for Visually Handicapped, recommends a size range of 16 to 18 points, while noting the differences between typefaces\cite{lhg:mtl}. Although the ADA Standards are silent on text-sizing, the WCAG includes some suggested constraints for text sizing: Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 suggest a “large-scale” text size of 18 points for regular text and 14 points for bold text. Additionally, Success Criterion 1.4.4 calls for users to be able to resize text up to 200\% “without loss of content or functionality” \cite{w3c:wcag}, meaning that students can experiment with smaller sizes, provided that those sizes work when doubled: either by adjusting the value the stylesheet or using the zoom feature in their development browser.

In introducing those values to students, it’s necessary to explain to students the conversion from points to pixels. While the pixel once represented both a physical and a logical unit, the W3C distinguishes between the physical pixels on a screen and logical reference pixels \cite[§~5.2]{w3c:values}, which may involve lighting multiple physical pixels on high-density displays. Values expressed as pixels, \verb|px|, in CSS are always reference pixels. One point is 1/72 of an inch, while CSS pixels are approximated as 1/96 of an inch, making 1 point roughly 1.333 CSS pixels. The range from 14 to 18 points can be therefore be expressed as a CSS-pixel range of roughly 19 to 24 pixels.

\subsection{Establishing the Baseline Grid}

Typographic convention sets the baseline grid anywhere from 120\% to 180\% of the base font size for body text \cite[p.~92]{jsm:owt}. The ideal baseline grid for a page is determined both by the size of the body text as well as the width of the column. The number of words on a line of text in a column is known as the {\itshape measure}; a readable measure on a single column of text is often between 45 and 75 characters, including spaces \cite[pp. 26–27]{rb:style}. Smaller measures can be set closer than larger measures, so long as the space is doing its primary job: aiding the eye's movement comfortably from the end of one line of text to the beginning of the next.

Pixel values for the \verb|line-height| that divide evenly into 2, 3, and 4 are convenient for  expressing half-, third-, and quarter-line adjustments between elements, especially for beginning students.

\subsection{Sizing Accent Type}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rdv-narrow}
  \caption{Text precisely set on a repeating baseline grid, with diagnostic grid lines shown.}
  \Description{The larger-sized headline copy occupies multiple grid lines, while each line of paragraph copy occupies just a single line.}
  \label{fig:rdv-narrow}
\end{figure}

The WCAG specification notes that “The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt)” \cite{w3c:wcag}--“the larger standard font size” being derived, presumably, from the traditional typographers scale represented in the text-sizing drop-down menus of writing software (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 points).

Students should be encouraged to experiment with different mathematical ratios to determine a scale. A 4:3 ratio, for example, with a base font-size of 18px would include 10.13px, 13.503px, 18px, 23.994px, and so on.  To keep the base-line grid harmonious and functional, students need to adjust the \verb|line-height| property on text that is larger or substantially smaller than their base font-size, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rdv-narrow}. Assuming a base font-size of 18px and a baseline grid of 22px, a heading set to 23.994px could be set comfortably on a gridline and a half (33px) or on a fully doubled gridline (44px).

\subsection{Refining the Grid}

Having established a base font size, a baseline grid, and a typographic scale, students move on to adding grid-determined space around elements. Both the \verb|margin| and \verb|padding| properties in CSS are appropriate for this task, although \verb|padding| behaves more predictably than \verb|margin|, as CSS will collapse adjacent margin values under particular circumstances.
An entire line of empty space can follow paragraph elements, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rdv-narrow}, while list items can be separated by a half line of space. An additional half line of space set on the list itself ensures that a list will be followed by an entire line of empty space, just like paragraphs.
Additional space, derived from the \verb|line-height| value for the typographic grid, can be added to the \verb|html| selector on its \verb|padding| property.

\subsection{Relative Units and Responsiveness}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rdv-wide}
  \caption{Text set larger in a wider RDV viewport, with diagnostic grid lines shown.}
  \Description{At a larger viewport, the text is run larger. Gridlines are still constant, and size relationships between headings and boy copy remain. Additional space appears on either side of the single column of text.}
  \label{fig:rdv-wide}
\end{figure}

Having inspected their work, including with the aid of a grid overlay such as can be provided by Basehold.it or using a simple piece of instructor-provided SVG, students can confirm the accuracy of their baseline grid and their ability to size and set type to it. Students should then begin to gradually convert their absolute pixel-values to relative em-values. Because browsers default to a 16-pixel em, students can convert their base \verb|font-size| by dividing by 16. So a 19-pixel \verb|font-size| is equivalent to \verb|1.1875em|.

That value becomes the new em value for the page. If the 19-pixel text is set on a 24-pixel baseline, the relative \verb|line-height| value is arrived at by calculating 24/19, or \linebreak \verb|1.2631578947em|. With each conversion to a relative unit, students should refresh their  browsers and ensure their work still shows perfect alignment with the overlay . Any deviations from the grid means that a relative value was calculated incorrectly.

With relative units uniformly in place, students can then begin to open up the RDV viewport further. Once the lines of text become too long to comfortably read, or exceed the recommended lengths for line measures referenced earlier, and adjustment is needed.

The primary mechanism for making adjustments are via CSS media queries, which conditionally apply their contained CSS based on a screen condition, such as \verb|min-width|. Students should use the width as displayed in the RDV to write the query. A media query may need only to introduce a larger \verb|font-size| set on the \verb|html| selector. All of the carefully determined ratios and size relationships will scale accordingly. Additional space to the left and right sides of the text column can also help keep the measure of the lines readable, as in Figure \ref{fig:rdv-wide}.

\section{Conclusion}

This approach to CSS instruction has proved challenging but rewarding for students. Instead of focusing on a growing number of properties, students learn to take their time arriving at very precise values for a select number of properties. Anecdotally, since employing this method, students generally seem much more adept at commanding more complex CSS modules later in the course, particularly CSS Flexible Boxes and CSS Grid, both of which feature a large number of interdependent properties.

\subsection{Planned Enhancements}

During fall semester 2020, this approach will be enhanced further to include additional responsive typography features unique to CSS, including molten leading and CSS locks \cite{tb:ml,tb:cl}.

Simultaneously, so as to gather data about the effectiveness of the technique, an instrument will be developed and tested with volunteer enrolled students for further refinement in the future.
